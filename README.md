- Staff members to be issued uniforms when they join the service.
- Tracking of uniform issues and eligibility for reissue after 24 months.
- Staff to order additional uniforms if needed.
- A user-friendly interface for managing staff, uniform issues, and orders.

- **Issue Uniform**: Track uniforms issued to staff, including quantities and issue dates.
- **Reissue Eligibility**: Identify uniforms eligible for reissue after 24 months.
- **Additional Uniform Orders**: Allow staff to place orders for additional uniforms and track these orders.
- **Reports**: Generate reports showing issued uniforms, reissue eligibility, and additional orders.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The backend logic of the system.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
