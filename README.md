- **Reissue Eligibility**: Identify uniforms eligible for reissue after 24 months.
- **Additional Uniform Orders**: Allow staff to place orders for additional uniforms and track these orders.
- **Reports**: Generate reports showing issued uniforms, reissue eligibility, and additional orders.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The backend logic of the system.
